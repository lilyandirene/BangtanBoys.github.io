# _Welcome, first time with BTS?_

Kpop is music from South Korea that started around the 90's. Solo artists and bands make up the scene. It comes in many genres of music, such as pop, rock, hip-hop, etc. The following of Kpop grew in the late 2000's, with groups becoming more popular: examples include EXO, TVXQ, and SNSD. One of the biggest boy groups today is **BTS**.

2017 is BTS's year. They became the first Kpop group to win the Top Social Artist Award at the Billboard Music Awards in the U.S. and was the first Korean boy group to perform at the American Music Awards show. If you haven't heard of them yet, it's about time that you do.
